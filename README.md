# SNARE-mCNN: identifying SNARE proteins using alignment-free method based on multi-scan convolutional neural network and PSSM profiles

### Dependencies
- Python 3
- Tensorflow 2

### Prediction step-by-step:
### Step 1
Use "pssm_encoding_generated.py" file to encode PSSM profiles into multi-scan data

### Step 2
Use "snare_deepscan_training.py" file to train model based on the generated PSSMs
